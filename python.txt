python documentation

there are 4 things to master for any programming language
1)terms of the language e.g. statements, variable e.t.c
2) learn about the language's data types... i.e. what sort of data can
 a program hold?
3)learn about performing actions
4)learn the best practice of each language

PYTHON DATA TYPES
values in python

data types are called:
#classes -- custom data type
#specialized == packages grab from modules or library

fundamental data types
int
float
bool
str
list
tuple
set
dict
None



int-integer
float-- floating point number, we have to make distinction in python 
because a float takes up a lot more space in memory than an int.
int and float data type are used for numbers
**==power
//==nearest int

MODULO
%= remainders


Math functions
ctrl / to comment every selected thing\

round= round to nearest whole
abs= return the absolute value of the argument
**python3 math functions


Developer fundamentals
1) don't read the dictionary--understand what exists, what you can use

OPERATOR PRECEDENCE
means difference math operator have precedence over other
**more like BODMAS

** == power
* / == multiplication and division

COMPLEX DATA TYPE
this is a third type number from int, float
not often used

every data is saved in binary
bin == prints binary of an int
print(bin(5)) == prints binary number of 5
binary numbers are base 2 numbers
print(int('0b101), 2) == prints the int of the binary
