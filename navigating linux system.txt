Navigating through linux

cd-choose directory(only works for dir)
usage
cd [dirname}
cd .. = go back one dir
ls-list
pwd-print working directory

create files using terminal
touch file1-creates file1
cat {filename}-writes out content of a file
echo {content} > {filename}-write a content into a file
nano- editor
nano {fn}-creates and edit any file=== ctrl O-save/ ctrl X to exit
python3 file.py-- run python programs

create directory
mkdir {dirname} - make directory
mkdir -p {dirname}
mv dir/* .
mv {fn} [dirname} - move file
cp-copy file1 file2
cp {fn} /hm/user/dirname/newfilename = copy file to a directory
rm fn- remove file
rm dirname -r = remove directory
rm * -r = removes evrything in kali
du == disk usage == displays a list of all the files along with their sizes
cat < - or cat ./-  == read out a dash filename
files with spaces name
to read it == cat 'files name'
to open a directory with space name== cd dir/'my directory'
sudo cp ‘my dir/my file’ files== to cp 'my file' from 'my dir' folder to files
how to list file types
file ./filename == lists file type
file ./filename* == list wildcards filetypes
find -type f -size ! -executable= to find a file with the size and non exec
find / -user username -group groupname -size filesize 2>&1
| grep -F -v Permission | grep -F -v directory

METERPRETER --help
sessions -i [session number] == start session
guid == get user id for session


grep
-F = fixed strings
-v = don't match stated string

sort filename | uniq -c -u == use to grep a line of text that occurs only
once in a file


sudo ifconfig-get ip address and all the network interface corrresponding

ctrl+O to save
ctrl+X to exit
reboot kali
ping should work after reboot
nc localhost [port]= connect to a port on same host



2>&1 ==which writes the output from one file to the input of another file.
2>&1 means that STDERR redirects to the target of STDOUT (which is the file dirlist)
We are redirecting error output to standard output which in turn is being
re-directed to file dirlist. Hence, both the output is written to file dirlist.

The 3>&1 in your command line will create a new file descriptor
and redirect it to 1 which is STDOUT .
Now 1>&2 will redirect the filedescriptor 1 to STDERR
and 2>&3 will redirect file descriptor 2 to 3 which is STDOUT
