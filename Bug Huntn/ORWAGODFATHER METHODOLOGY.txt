1) content discovery: Ffuf or dirsearch

2) wordlists: Random Robbie Word list github

3) SUBDOMAIN ENUM: Amass
a) For List of domains==> amass enum -passive -norecursive -noalts -df list-domains.txt -o subs.txt

!!) amass enum -passive -norecursive -noalts -df domains.txt -o subdomains.txt

b) For Senile domain==> amass enum -passive -norecursive -noalts -d domain -o subs.txt

4) httpx, httprobe & Nmap
A)   cat subs.txt | httpx -o live-subs.txt


B)  cat sub.txt | httprobe -p http:81 -p http:3000 -p https:3000 -p http:3001 -p https:3001 -p http:8000 -p http:8080 -p https:8443 -p https:10000 -p http:9000 -p https:9443 -c 50 | tee live-subs2.txt


C). subfinder -d target.com -silent| httpx -title -tech-detect -status-code

5))PORT Scanning
Naabu

naabu -list newsubs.txt -p - -exclude-ports 80,443,8080,22,25 -o newegg_port_result.txt

Also send Subs-list to Nmap for port scanning

***Nmap i run it on VPS because take lot time

nmap -sV -iL subdomains.txt -oN scaned-port.txt --script=vuln


Optional>>> masscan -p1-65355 -iL $ipfile â€”-max-rate 1800 -oG $outputFile.log

NB: masscan only takes ips, so we have to use dnmasscan to get ips


5) Wappalyzer

6) Burp Pro With These Extensions
Collaborator Everywhere
XSS Validator
Wsdler
.NET Beautifier
Bypass WAF
J2EEScan
Param Miner
Wayback Machine
JS Link Finder
Upload Scanner
Nucleus Burp Extension
Software Vulnerability Scanner
Active Scan++

Github DORKING>>> org:facebookresearch language:python .php

So after that i Spider the Full host and and fuzz for php using php word list and after that Active Scan on Burp for ALL the Post Request

Keep the Maximum insertion point per base request 10`

*AUTHENTICATION BYPASS*
but on burp when visit one 
will redirect but the Content-Length of redirect response so big 6443
After looking in the response he found out in this 302 response, the panel was without any Authentication. in the 302 response content

#Repro Steps
1. IN burp match and replace add this:
type: response header
match : HTTP/1.1 302 Found
replace: HTTP/1.1 200 ok
__
type: response header
match : Location: ../login/?redirect=//location/?5
replace:
2. now go to domian//location/?5
BooM
4. when you done you can report


SHODAN

2 SHODAN IP And SSTI To RCE
Started recon for Ip belongs for Facebook

the good dork you can use in these case

if you looking for domains or Ip belong for program

Org:"FaceBook Inc." without 200 dont need live Ip in these case

if you looking for cool subs or Ip on the domain

Ssl.cert.subject.CN:"facebook.com" 200

so found a interesting Ip that include port 10000 but not working

so i scan that Ip on Nmap Nmap -sV ip

its show Port 8443 Open


3 Privilege Escalation
here i visit crt.sh to tack about 5 interesting domains

https://crt.sh/?q=Facebook+Inc.
but for subdomains gathering i dont wanna the normal way

i fuzz for sub domains with a good and big word list i made it

you can also made one for you

after that filtered to Live using httprobe

cat sub.txt | httprobe -p http:81 -p http:3000 -p https:3000 -p http:3001 -p https:3001 -p http:8000 -p http:8080 -p https:8443 -p https:10000 -p http:9000 -p https:9443 -c 50 | tee live-subs2.txt

so found here domain run on Port 10000

so when i visit it was a interesting panel for mange servers and lot of other things

so when check on its run with lot of technologies

dirsearch on the panel and saw misconfiguration that some endpoints is accessible without any login ok its cool find to report but still

without any Privilege like edit , del , add etc..

so i need to keep working to find something good

i also try login with some default Credentials but not working also try to sing up but the register cant be without login using admin Credentials
by check on some endpoints i found server Info with that info full name of the admin who create that
so its take 5 min to find that employee repo on github

so start dorking on employee repo for any password

i try

password
passwd 
pwd
pass
pw
login
found internal host and user and password github leak like these

$host = ****
$User = ****
$pwd  = ****
scanned the internal host for ports nothing open

so i try to login use the username and the password and BooM ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¥³ its work with Full Privilege

after Login i can

Full Access and Control
add users
del users
Etc...
also 1 stored XSS in these panel

Org Name:
 SHODAN, Crt.sh,securitytrails


Save domains and ip to list to scan

Send domains to Amass for subs

Send Subs-list for live probe (httpx or httprobe)

Also send Subs-list to Nmap for port scanning

***Nmap i run it on VPS because take lot time

nmap -sV -iL subdomains.txt -oN scaned-port.txt --script=vuln



after that i start Looked for 403 subs and start Fuzzing to Find some Cool EndPoints
you can use for that Dirserch , FFUF ,

For me if i work on little subs i send that to Burp ===> Spider this Host ===> while Spider working
I  visit github dorking for these sub domain "sub.domain.com" if here any link will move to Spider

2 Visit Google site:sub.domain.com also if here any link will move to Spider

3 Visit web.archive

https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=*.sub.domain.com&fl=original&collapse=urlkey
also if here any link will move to Spider



Fuzz On Spider. To do that send the host to Intruder ===> add WordList ===> Start Attack

you can also on Intruder give a Payload list and Start attack on some parameters SQL,SSTI,SSRF,LFI,XSS,Etc..
any cool end do an active Scan

add Parameters list for Param Miner also to check on hidden parameters on burp
while all of this runs i dorking on Github for some finds
